    # Install dependencies.
    sudo apt install mercurial python python-matplotlib python-simplejson
    # Clone Lab repository.
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jendrikseipp/lab /path/to/lab

Notes about requirements:

* Lab needs Python 2.7 or Python >= 3.5.
* python-matplotlib is only needed for reports that generate graphs.
* python-simplejson is optional, but makes generating reports much faster.

Add to your ``.bashrc`` to make Lab available on the ``PYTHONPATH``::

    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/lab

Update shell configuration::

    source ~/.bashrc

Install Lab in a virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An alternative way to install Lab is by using a `Python virtual
environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_. This has
the advantage that there is no modification to the system-wide
configuration, and that you can create multiple environments with
different Lab versions (e.g., for different papers) with no conflicts
at all. Using Python 3, you would proceed like this::

    # Install required packages, including virtualenv.
    sudo apt install mercurial python3 python3-venv
    # Create and activate a Python 3 virtual environment for Lab.
    python3 -m venv lab-venv  # Or any other name instead of lab-venv
    source lab-venv/bin/activate

    # Clone Lab repository.
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jendrikseipp/lab /path/to/lab
    # Perform the installation.
    pip install -e /path/to/lab

The ``-e`` flag in the last command is optional. It installs the project
in "editable mode", which is better suited if you need to change the Lab
source code, since any changes under ``/path/to/lab`` are immediately
reflected in the installed package.
