Fast Downward benchmark collection
==================================

An inofficial collection of (sequential) IPC benchmark instances.

suites.py contains many predefined benchmark suites such as
"optimal_strips", "satisficing", or "all". To obtain the
corresponding domain list for your experiments you can run

    ./suites.py optimal_strips

Please note that some IPC 2014 domains from the satisificing (sat)
track were also used in the multicore (mco) and agile (agl) tracks.
Please consult suites.py for the full domain lists of these two tracks.

The "optimal_strips" suite has been uploaded to Zenodo to make it citable:
